Zard is a platform to facilitate, catalyze, and stimulate market flow at the local level as well as provide relief and convenience economically

## Inspiration
We built Zard to mitigate the impact that small businesses have had due to the pandemic.

## What it does
The app allows three different user roles: customers, sellers, and manufacturers. Depending on the user role, a user can either sell products or view products posted by local businesses. The app also allows additional functionality like the ability to view reviews and view previous interactions.

## How we built it
Zard is built with Flutter, a UI Software Development Kit. We choose Flutter to maximize the number of people that can access and experience our app. Because we used Flutter, our app is compatible on both Android devices and iPhones.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenges we faced involved converting our project from design into a viable product and setting up authentication. Collectively, we have minimal prior knowledge with Flutter, so there was definitely a lot of learning involved.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of closely converting the design into code. Another feature we're proud of is incorporating system dark mode in our app in both IOS and Android.

## What we learned
We are a lot more proficient in Flutter as a result of this project and it's rather unique requirements. Additionally, we better learned how to use tools to maximize efficiency when working in a project in a group.

What's next for Zard
In the future, we plan on adding Zard on new platforms, like the web, along with better integration with back-end services.
